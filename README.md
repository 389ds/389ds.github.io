# 389 Directory Server Wiki

## Getting Started

You can test our your changes locally with:

`docker build -t 389wiki:latest .`
`docker run -p 4000:4000 389wiki:latest`

This will then listen and server http://localhost:4000

If you want to setup a more permanent editing environment:

1. `yum install python-pygments gcc ruby-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel`

1. Install [RVM](http://rvm.io). I know RVM can be a pain when you first start
   using it, but you will enjoy life more if you aren't dealing with conflicting
   gems all the time.  Note: do **NOT** install RVM as root.

   First you must configure your terminal emulator to act as a login shell.  In
   gnome-terminal, go to "Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title and Command".
   Check the box reading "Run command as login shell."  In xfce4-terminal, go to
   "Edit -> Preferences" and check the "Run command as login shell" box.  See
   <https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal>

   Start a new terminal and follow the
   [instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/security) and then run

   ```
   $ rvm install ruby-2.5
   ```

   The documentation for RVM is extensive so don't be afraid to read it.
1. Go into your checkout directory and run `gem install bundler && bundle
   install`
1. (Optional) Install and configure Travis.  This will allow you to interact
   with the continuous integration environment from the command line.

   ```
   gem install travis
   travis login --org
   ```
1. Render the site with `jekyll serve --watch`.  (See Advanced Workflow section
   for tips on getting real time previews of your updates).
1. Make changes and save.  If you wish to create a news item, run `jekyll post
   "My Title"`.  That command calls out to a plugin that will create a file with
   the correct name and format and open your editor as defined by VISUAL or
   EDITOR.  You can use a different editor with the `--editor` option.
1. Jekyll will automatically render your changes.

## Advanced Workflow
1. *Optional*: Open port 4000 in your firewall so others can see your local site

    ```
    $ firewall-cmd --add-port=4000/tcp --permanent
    ```
2. If you wish to see real time previews of your updates (i.e. if you don't
   want to hit the refresh button all the time), then you can use
   `jekyll serve --livereload`.

3. **Extreme ProTip**: Unfortunately, Jekyll is a bit simplistic in how it
   regenerates sites.  It regenerates everything instead of just what it needs
   to.  The Jekyll team has recognized this deficiency and has added an
   experimental option `--incremental`/`-I` that attempts to only regenerate the
   pages that actually changed.  In my experience, it works well, so use it!

## Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting is provided by [Pygments](http://pygments.org) (more
specifically by Pygments.rb -- a Ruby binding to Pygments).  Set the
highlighting on a code block by providing a lexer name after the three backticks
that indicate the beginning of a code block.

The list of lexers is available at <http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>, but in
general they are named like you would expect.  The most common ones we use are

* java
* ruby
* python
* console (a Bash console session)
* json
* properties (Java Properties format)
* bash (a Bash script)
* sql
* ini (for Python conf files)
* yaml

A special note about the console lexer: if the line is a command, you must begin
with a "$", "#", or "%" otherwise the text will be treated as output.  E.g.

**Correct**

```console
$ ./subscription-manager
```

**INCORRECT**

```console
./subscription-manager
```

## Gotchas
* In Markdown, whitespace matters!  Specifically, when you're in a block (like a
  list element in a bulleted list) you need to make sure all sub-blocks have the
  same initial indentation.

**Correct**
<pre>
* Hello World looks like
  ```
  print "Hello World"
  ```
</pre>

**INCORRECT**
<pre>
* Hello World looks like
```
print "Hello World"
```
</pre>

* Be careful with internal links.  Preface them with {{ site.baseurl }} if they
  are in another directory.  See
  <http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project_page_url_structure>
* The URLs for all posts and pages contain a leading slash so there is no need
  to provide one.  E.g. Linking to a post would use {{ site.baseurl }}{{
  post.url }}

# Tips
* If you want to see an overview of an object in Liquid, filter it through the
  debug filter from `_plugins.` E.g. `{{ page | debug }}`
* To find code blocks missing a lexer, install pcre-tools and use the following
  `pcregrep -r -M -n '^$\n^```$' *`
* Vim associates '.md' files with Modula-2.  Add the following to your .vimrc to
  change the association:

  ```
  autocmd BufNewFile,BufReadPost *.md set filetype=markdown
  ```

## Openshift Setup
To interact with Openshift, you will need to install the command line client
`oc`.  It is not available as an RPM since it's just a massive statically-linked
binary.  The [documenation](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)
has a download link that will require you to log in to the Red Hat portal.  Once
you have the file, unzip it and place the `oc` file in a directory on your path.
I have a directory `~/bin` that is on my path, so that was the most convenient
place for me.

Next you will need to authenticate.  Run `oc login` and follow the prompts.

## Environment Variables and Build and Run Processes
Any environment variables that we need to define (such as the BUNDLE_WITHOUT
variable to exclude gems from a group in the Gemfile) are defined in
`.s2i/environment`.

* We use RVM to manage Ruby versions and gemsets.  See
  <https://rvm.io/#docindex>
* Jekyll is the engine used to create the site.  There is very good
  documentation at <http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/>
* We are using Kramdown as our Markdown renderer. There is a quick reference at
  <http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html> and a more complete syntax guide

* The CSS is written using Sass <http://sass-lang.org>.
* The JS and theming are courtesy of Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>
  although I did strip out some of the JS that we probably would not use like
  the carousel and modal dialog functions.
