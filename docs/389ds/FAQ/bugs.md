### [389 Trac](https://fedorahosted.org/389/)

The 389 Directory Server project uses Trac for tracking all development work (bugs, new features, etc.). Our Trac instance is hosted by fedorahosted.org, so anyone with a Fedora Project account can file new tickets.

-   [Register a Fedora Project Account](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/) if you don't already have one
-   [Access 389 Trac](https://fedorahosted.org/389/)
-   [File a New Ticket](https://fedorahosted.org/389/newticket)
    - <font color="RED">When filing a new ticket please provide a detailed reproducible testcase, and attach any useful files(patches, stack traces, log snippets, config files, etc)</font>

The old bug system is Red Hat Bugzilla <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> - information about old bugs can be found there
