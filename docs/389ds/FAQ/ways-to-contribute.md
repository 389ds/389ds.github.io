Continuous Integration Testing([lib389](FAQ/upstream-test-framework.html)) - Add your own test cases!


Contributions are not limited to code patches
---------------------------------------------

There are lots of ways to contribute to the success of the project, including:

-   [Submit bug reports](bugs.html)
-   [Suggest new features](wishlist.html)
-   Make other comments on how to improve the the quality of the program
-   Help write good [documentation](../documentation.html)
-   Participate on the [mailing lists and IRC](../mailing-lists.html)
-   Contribute to this [Wiki](../howto/howto-write-wiki-page.html)

Want to help code the project?
------------------------------

Here are some general suggestions for where to begin:

-   Get the source. read the code, and build it - [Developers](../development.html)
-   Start small
-   Learn the [build process](../development/building.html) and help improve it!
-   Submit [patches](../development/git-rules.html) (and don't be discouraged if they are rejected or heavily modified)
-   Work on an item on the [Wishlist](wishlist.html)
-   Add Continuous Integration Testing patches([lib389](FAQ/upstream-test-framework.html))

When submitting patches, please use [git format-patch](../development/git-rules.html) to create patch files, or if working directly from a source file and not using git, use the unified diff format. See our [Coding Style](../development/coding-style.html) guidelines for more information.
