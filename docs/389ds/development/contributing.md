# Contributing
-----------------

There are quite a few [ways to contribute](../FAQ/ways-to-contribute.html) to the Directory Server project. If one of the things that you want to contribute happens to be code or patches, there are a few simple steps you have to follow.

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

If you want to submit code and patches you need to sign the Fedora [Individual Contributor License Agreement](individual-contributor-license-agreement.html). If you're working for an employer and they own the rights to your code, then you should make sure that your employer will permit you to sign the Fedora ICLA. If your employer will not permit you to sign the Fedora ICLA, please email <legal@fedoraproject.org> with the specific issues, and we will try to make a custom arrangement.

### Individual Contributor License Agreement

This is easy to do. Just follow these steps:

-   Go to <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/user/new> and create a new account - or Login if you already have an account
-   Go to <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/cla/> and submit the on-line form
    -   Some older versions of this text say that you have to print out, sign, and mail/fax/email the form. This is no longer a requirement for the ICLA - the click through is sufficient for the ICLA.

If you've been given a git/CVS account
--------------------------------------

If you've been given a git/CVS account then you need to get set up in the Fedora Accounts system. Visit the [Fedora Accounts System](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/) page. This page will set up a system whereby you can sign an Individual CLA as well as set up your account information. There's also a page that describes what you have to do to [create the keys](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject/UsingGpg/CreatingKeys) you'll need to finish and sign the forms on the fedora account page in order to get CVS commit access.

About the CLA
-------------

The contributor license agreement basically says (without this being real legal advice) that contributors who make any contributions given to Fedora (and 389) without a license give Fedora (and 389) permission to use those contributions under broad and permissive license terms. Any contributions made with an explicit license will remain under those license terms (but Fedora and 389 are under no obligation to use any contribution). You are NOT assigning your copyright to Red Hat, Fedora, or 389. It also includes a patent grant. The intent of this agreement is to ensure that Fedora and 389 is available to everyone under safe and Free licensing terms.
