# Individual Contributor License Agreement
------------------------------------------

All Fedora (and 389) contributors need to electronically agree to the Fedora Individual CLA. If you are a Fedora contributor and have been approved to the cla\_done group, that's all you need to do.

See [<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal/Licenses/CLA>](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal/Licenses/CLA) and [<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Licenses>](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Licenses) for more information.
