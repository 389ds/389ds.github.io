# Red Hat Directory Server Documentation
----------------------------------------

The best documentation for use and deployment can be found in the [Red Hat Directory Server documentation](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/). Although these documents are for Red Hat Directory Server, they apply to 389 DS as well. However, be sure to read the [Release Notes](releases/release-notes.html) and [Install Guide](legacy/install-guide.html) for 389 DS first in case there are important differences.

These are the official Red Hat Directory Server 9 docs, but they apply to 389 1.2 and later releases:

-   [Deployment Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/9.0/html/Deployment_Guide/index.html) - Planning your directory server deployment
-   [Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/9.0/html/Installation_Guide/index.html) - Step by step guide to installation, setup, and migration
-   [Administrator's Guide](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/9.0/html/Administration_Guide/index.html) - Server Administration using the console, command line, and files
-   [Configuration, Command, and File Reference](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/9.0/html/Configuration_Command_and_File_Reference/index.html) - Reference guide to configuration entries, attributes, command line utilities, and files
-   [Fedora DS Documentation in Spanish (not official)](http://wiki.fedora-ve.org/Autenticaci%C3%B3n/FedoraDirectoryServer)
