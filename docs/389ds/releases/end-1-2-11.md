389 Directory Server 1.2.11.X Discontinued for EL6
--------------------------------------------------

The 389 Directory Server team announces the binary release of 389-ds-base version 1.2.11 for EL6 will be stopped via temporary COPR repository. We encourage you to switch it to the official version included in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 distribution or its equivalent OS.

### How to switch to the official version

Remove a yum repo file which points to the temporary COPR repository (e.g., nhosoi-389-ds-base-epel6-epel-6.repo) from /etc/yum.repos.d.

If the current 389 Directory Server 1.2.11 has the greater build number than 15, for instance, 1.2.11.32, downgrade it once by "yum downgrade" as follows.

`yum downgrade 389-ds-base 389-ds-base-libs`

Then, upgrade to make sure you have the latest version.

`yum upgrade 389-ds-base`

After upgrade completes, run **setup-ds-admin.pl -u** to update your directory server/admin server/console information.

`setup-ds-admin.pl -u`
