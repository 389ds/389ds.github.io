#### 389 has converted from CVS to git for SCM

389 has switched from using the venerable CVS to using git for our SCM. All new development will take place in our new git repositories. The old CVS repositories are still available, but they won't be used for any new code. Some projects will still use the CVS repository, such as mod\_nss, mod\_revocator, coolkey, esc, windowsautoenroll, and console (just the idm console framework code - the rest of the console packages have moved to git).

#### Fedora Directory Server is now **389**

The Fedora Directory Server Project is now called "389". The details are here:

The new project website is <http://port389.org> (which is currently just an alias for directory.fedoraproject.org)

The new IRC channel is \#389

We have created aliases for the mailing lists - so 389-users, 389-announce, etc.

We're still in the process of rebranding, re-skinning the web site, etc. In the coming weeks you will see new packages with the 389 branding.

Everything else is the same - the team, our mission, only the name has changed. We apologize if this change is disconcerting to some of you, we thank your for your support, and we hope to continue to make the 389 project a success.

The shell script */usr/sbin/setup-ds-dsgw* is provided to configure the applications and enable them to be used from the Admin Server home page (as in 1.0 and earlier versions). See the [DSGW\_Install\_Guide](../administration/dsgw-install-guide.html) for more information.

#### Security vulnerability in fedora-ds-admin (April 22, 2008)

The fedora-ds-admin-1.1.0 package has a couple of security vulnerabilities:

-   CVE-2008-0892 Directory Server: shell command injection in CGI replication monitor - <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437301>
-   CVE-2008-0893 Directory Server: unrestricted access to CGI scripts - <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=437320>

The new package is fedora-ds-admin-1.1.4-1 This package is available from the Fedora yum repository for F-7 and later, or from the dirsrv yum repo on Fedora 6 and EL5. See [Install\_Guide](../legacy/install-guide.html) for information about how to use these yum repositories for your platform.

There are also updates to the adminutil (new version 1.1.6) and to some of the other packages. These updates are recommended.

**NOTE:** the vulnerabilities affect all versions of Fedora DS, including 1.0.4. We currently have no plans to do another binary RPM release. Please see the bug reports to find out how to patch earlier releases.

**NOTE for Fedora 8 and later users:** all of the packages are now in the standard Fedora repos. Please remove your /etc/yum.repos.d/idmcommon.repo and /etc/yum.repos.d/dirsrv.repo files before you install or upgrade. See [Install\_Guide](../legacy/install-guide.html) for more information.

**NOTE for Fedora 6, 7 and EL5 users:** You may get an error about a missing dependency fedora-admin-console when upgrading. If you get this error, remove the old fedora-ds package (yum erase fedora-ds) and upgrade again.

#### Security vulnerability in fedora-idm-console (March 19, 2008)

The fedora-idm-console-1.1.0 package has a security vulnerability - details are here: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=436101>

A new version of the package is now available - fedora-idm-console-1.1.1-1 - to fix the problem. [Download](../download.html) contains instructions about how to set up your yum repositories to get this update, then do

#### Fedora DS 1.1 is new feature code complete (October 9, 2007)

The code has been completed for the new features in Fedora DS 1.1. Our focus now is on whittling down the bug list, testing, and updating the documentation. We're also planning how to build and release the admin server and console pieces through our own yum repository.

#### Notice: File/Path Naming Has Changed (September 18, 2007)

If you are using the fedora-ds-base (version 1.1.0-0.3 or earlier) included in the Fedora distro, please be aware that the file/path naming has been changed in later packages (1.1.0-1.0 and later).

**If you upgrade from 1.1.0-0.3 to 1.1.0-1.0 or later, you will break all of the scripts and configuration files, because they will all still refer to the old paths.**

Files/paths in older versions that had **fedora-ds** in the name now use **dirsrv**. For example:

-   The init script/service is now called **dirsrv** not **fedora-ds**

    service dirsrv start    

instead of

    service fedora-ds start    

-   The configuration directory is now **/etc/dirsrv** instead of **/etc/fedora-ds**
-   The scripts such as **db2ldif**, **ldif2db**, etc. are in \$libdir/dirsrv/slapd-instance instead of \$libdir/fedora-ds/slapd-instance.
-   The sub directories under /var - /var/log/dirsrv, /var/lib/dirsrv, etc.

We are working on this issue and will provide migration instructions/scripts.

#### Work is proceeding on Fedora DS 1.1 (September 17, 2007)

Fedora DS 1.1 will have the following:

-   Discrete packaging - several small packages instead of one monolithic package that contains redundant components - [Discrete\_Packaging](../legacy/discrete-packaging)
-   Filesystem Hierarchy Standard file and path layout - everything will be where you expect it to be - [FHS\_Packaging](../development/fhs-packaging.html)
-   Migration support - easy upgrade/migration from 1.0 and earlier releases - [DS Admin Migration](../howto/howto-ds-admin-migration.html) and [Migration From 10](../legacy/migration-from-10.html)
-   Easier, more flexible set up - [FDS Setup](../legacy/fhs-setup.html) and [New\_Setup\_Design](../FAQ/new-setup-design.html)

#### Fedora DS gets posix/unix automatic uid generation (February 08, 2007)

The cvs head now contains a new feature for automatic generation of sequenced numbers which is compatible with multi-master replication environments. This feature can be used for automatic generation of posix uidNumber and gidNumber in addition to other sequenced numeric attributes required by your deployment.
