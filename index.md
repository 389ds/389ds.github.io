# 389 Directory Server
{: #front-page-title}

---

The enterprise-class [Open Source](docs/389ds/FAQ/licensing.html) LDAP server for Linux. LDAP is a
protocol for representing objects in a network database. Commonly LDAP servers are used to store
identities, groups and organisation data, however LDAP can be used as a structured NoSQL server.
389 Directory Server is hardened by real-world use, is full-featured, supports multi-master
replication, and already handles many of the largest LDAP deployments in the world.
The **389 Directory Server** can be downloaded for free, and set up in less than an hour.
